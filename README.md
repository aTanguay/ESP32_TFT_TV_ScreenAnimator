# ESP32_TFT_TV_ScreenAnimator
 Using a TTGO ESP32 module, animate random colors and effects to mimic a TV screen glow for art projects.
 
 Super simple series of bashed together clips makes this a fairly effective mini TV monitor for projects.
 
 I mounted this one in a little 'house' above a little free Library. At night it glows like someone lives up there, watching TV for a few hours.
